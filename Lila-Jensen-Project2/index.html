        Fabrics can be woven from many types of fibers, with even more options
        available since the industrial revolution. While many synthetic fabrics
        dominate the market, many consumers are beginning to seek out naturally
        sourced options, both for comfort and sustainability. Here we will
        explore the popular natural fabrics and their pros and cons in use.

        Wool is a natural fiber that primarily comes from sheep. Australian
        Merino sheep's wool is widely considered to be the best, but fibers are
        also sourced from rabbits (angora), goats (cashmere and mohair), llamas
        and alpacas, and even camels. No animals need be harmed for wool to be
        harvested. Wool can be reprocess and reused/ rewoven, sometimes mixed
        with other fibers, making it more sustainable.

          <li>Warm in winter and cool in summer, wool breathes with the body and allows for airflow</li>
          <li>Absorbs moisture better than other natural fibers, and will absorb up to 30% of its weight before it even feels wet</li>

          <li>Ideal to tailor as wool is easy to shape with a steamer</li>

          <li>Will be bleached by prolonged exposure to sunlight</li>
          <li>Can be damaged by moths as some species feed on the fibers, however proper storage and prevention is possible</li>

        Cotton is one of the most popular and versatile of the fabrics, cotton
        is a natural fiber made from the fluffy seed pods, or bolls, of the
        cotton plant. Cotton has been in use since ancient times, with today's
        top cotton producers being India, the US, and several middle eastern
        countries. Cotton farming takes up 2.5% of the worlds arable land, and
        has been cultivated across the world for centuries.

        Hemp fiber is a natural material from the stem of the cannabis plant. It
        has been used for centuries as fabric, rope, and other industrial
        applications. Hemp was also commonly used to make sail canvas. The word
        "canvas" is derived from the word cannabis. Pure hemp fabric has a
        similar texture to Linen. It is a sustainable fiber and is extremely
        durable, used today in clothes, shoes, pet gear, and more.

        Silk is sometimes called the queen of fabrics, and is made from the
        natural fibers of silkworm cocoons. Luxurious and strong, and often
        quite expensive, silk dates back thousands of years to its development
        as a fabric in China. The process of silk making was a closely guarded
        secret until 300 AD, and this elusive fabric is the namesake for the
        silk road, an ancient trade route from China to Europe.

        Linen is a natural fiber that comes from the flax plant stem. Courser
        than cotton, it is sometimes mixed with cotton or silk to soften the
        texture, however it dries faster than cotton on its own and is very
        strong and absorbent. Linen typically takes longer to produce than
        cotton, and is incredibly old, with dyed fibers found in an
        archaeological cave site dating back as far as 30,000 years.
