   <p> Once upon a time a nervous student named Lila took a coding class she couldn’t understand a word of. She tried her very hardest, and it has just started, but found her brain jumbling words and mixing letters. She hopes one day she will figure out what the heck is going on, and for now she just stresses like a nervous geriatric toy poodle in an old lady’s purse. </p>
