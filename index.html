   <p> Once upon a time a nervous student named Lila took a coding class she couldn’t understand a word of. She tried her very hardest, and it has just started, but found her brain jumbling words and mixing letters. She hopes one day she will figure out what the heck is going on, and for now she just stresses like a nervous geriatric toy poodle in an old lady’s purse. So she wrote a crappy poem to get through the worst.. Like many classes she will try her best but often times she is overly stressed, her mind cannot focus and her backpacks a mess, she doubts that her coding will ever impress. She really needs to get her words to 150, so now she's writing in rhyme and the quality is iffy. She feels like a prey animal in fight or flight mode, but in reality she's just scared of html code. </p>
